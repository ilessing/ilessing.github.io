title: Leveraging the Aleph API for improvements to the Web OPAC
---

We've been making use of some of the Aleph Restful API's for Aleph which is our Integrated Library System (ILS) from Exlibris Software.


H2 Projects:
# Integrate with Aeon the Special Collections curculation and tracking system.
# Add a Faculty Driven Acquisitions feature which provides faculty to recommend a purchase when a title they search for is not in already in our collection.
