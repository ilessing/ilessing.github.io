title: Integrate Aleph and Aeon

### Integrate Aleph and Aeon

Aleph is our ILS system.  It is a big expensive proprietary system from [Exlibris Software](http://www.exlibrisgroup.com) which we've been using since 2001 which is 14 years now!  Anyway Exlibris has some [Restful APIs](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/aleph) available.  It is a little tricky in that they have three APIs rather than just one but there is little we can do about that.  

[Aeon](http://www.atlas-sys.com/aeon/) is a system for Special Collections we just adopted in 2014.

The objective for integrating these two systems was to display a button in the Web OPAC just for Special Collections items that when clicked will display and pre-fill an Aeon form.
